# Snapper-Rollback

Python script to rollback BTRFS systems using the [ArchWiki suggested subvolume layout](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Snapper#Suggested_filesystem_layout)

Restore of UKI's from snapshot to keep kernel in sync with snapshot. A few additional rollback scripts.
## Installation
### ArchLinux
Install through the AUR, or download the [PKGBUILD file](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=snapper-rollback) and run `makepkg -sri` while in the same directory

### Other
```
git clone 'https://github.com/jrabinow/snapper-rollback.git'
cd snapper-rollback
sudo cp snapper-rollback.py /usr/local/sbin/snapper-rollback
sudo cp snapper-rollback.conf /etc/
```

## Config file
Edit `/etc/snapper-rollback.conf` and make sure all the settings have the right
values. You don't have to do this, but if you don't, you'll have to manually
mount your btrfs root subvolume to `/btrfsroot` before running the script. Uncomment
external_boot = True to have your .bootbackup restored. 

This modded version adds an /efi backup hook to Pacman. /efi will be backed up to
/.bootbackup every kernel upgrade-install. This will happen whether you decide to
restore it or not.

## Usage
```
usage: snapper-rollback.py [-h] [--dry-run] [-c CONFIG] SNAPID
